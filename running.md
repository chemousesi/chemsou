# How to Run 5km in Less Than 20 Minutes

**Disclaimer:** For tailored advice, consult your doctor.

This is a personal guide based on my experience and the strategies I found most effective to achieve a sub-20-minute 5km run. If you're short on time, feel free to skip to the **Takeaways** at the end.

## 1. Why Do You Run?

Having a clear purpose can be a game-changer. Are you running for fun, preparing for a race, or improving your performance in another sport? Understanding *why* you run can help you stay mentally prepared and motivated. Your reasons don’t have to be set in stone—they can evolve over time.

Set a goal early on. Having a tangible objective will push you to commit and take action.

## 2. Fix a Goal and Learning Path

When you start running, it’s easy to feel good and overly ambitious—maybe even ready to sign up for a marathon! Confidence is great, but progress is better achieved step by step. Define a realistic learning path that aligns with your current ability.

For a sub-20-minute 5km, my progression looked like this:
- Start by running 7km at a comfortable pace (around 5:30 per km).
- Build up to 10km with negative splits until you can complete it in under 1 hour.
- Work on running 5km in under 30 minutes, then gradually improve until you reach 20 minutes.

Taking these incremental steps prevents burnout and builds confidence.

## 3. Have a Friend

If I had to summarize the difficulty of running alone, it’s this: the challenge increases as the number of people running with you decreases. Running solo requires strict discipline or a burst of motivation (like a New Year’s resolution). But when you have a friend, all you need is to agree on a time. With a group? Just put on your shoes and go.

Having a running buddy or group can make training enjoyable and sustainable. For me, my friend A., an avid runner, inspired me to take on this challenge. Now, we run together regularly!

Recently, I even joined a running club in Paris, which has made the sport a social and fun experience.

## 4. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat

Consistency is key. I wish I could share my Strava account, but suffice it to say, reaching my goal took over a year of semi-regular training and multiple failed attempts.

Here’s how my journey went:
- **Attempt #1**: Fail
- **Attempt #2**: Fail
- **Attempt #3**: Fail
- **Attempt #4**: Fail
- **Attempt #5**: Success!

Each failure was a learning experience. Stick with it, and eventually, you’ll get there too.

## Takeaways

To achieve a sub-20-minute 5km, focus on:
1. Understanding why you run.
2. Setting clear goals and a realistic training path.
3. Training with a friend or group to stay motivated.

Let me know when you hit this milestone—I’d love to hear about your progress!
